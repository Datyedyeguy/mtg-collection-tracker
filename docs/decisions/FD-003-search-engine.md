# FD-003: Search Engine

**Status**: Deferred to Phase 9

## Context

For advanced card search (Scryfall-style query language).

## Options

- **PostgreSQL full-text search** (built-in, good enough)
- **Azure AI Search** (formerly Cognitive Search, powerful but $$$)
- **Elasticsearch** (self-hosted, complex)
- **Meilisearch** (modern, fast, OSS)

## Decision

To be determined when Phase 9 begins.
