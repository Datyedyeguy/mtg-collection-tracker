# MTG Collection Tracker

A comprehensive web-based collection management system for Magic: The Gathering cards across multiple platforms.

## Features

- 📦 **Multi-Platform Support**: Track collections in Paper, MTG Arena, and MTG Online
- 🎯 **Smart Imports**: Support for Moxfield, Manabox, CSV, and direct MTGA/MTGO integration
- 📍 **Physical Location Tracking**: Know exactly where your paper cards are (decks, binders, storage)
- 🎴 **Decklist Management**: Store and organize your decklists
- 🔄 **Delta Imports**: Efficiently update collections with only changes
- 🌐 **Web & Mobile**: Responsive design with future native mobile app support
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: Your collection data is private and secure
- 💰 **Learning Project**: Azure-hosted with <$150/month budget for exploring cloud services

## Quick Start

### For Users

1. **Visit the website**: https://example.com (domain TBD - coming soon)
2. **Create an account**: Sign up with your email
3. **Import your collection**:
   - **Paper**: Upload CSV from Moxfield, Manabox, or other platforms
   - **MTG Arena**: Download and run our [Windows desktop client](#mtga-client)
   - **MTG Online**: Export collection and upload the file

### MTGA Client

The MTG Arena desktop client automatically extracts your collection from **MTGA log files**:

1. Download: [Latest Release](https://github.com/Datyedyeguy/mtg-collection-tracker/releases/latest)
2. Run the installer
3. **Enable in MTGA**: Settings → Account → "Detailed Logs (Plugin Support)"
4. Launch the MTG Collection Tracker client
5. Click "Sync Collection" - logs are read and uploaded automatically

**How it works**: The client reads log files that MTGA writes locally using the official "Plugin Support" feature. Same method used by 17Lands and other popular trackers.

**Requirements**: Windows 10/11 or macOS, MTG Arena installed

**Safety**:

- ✅ ToS-compliant (explicitly authorized by Wizards)
- ✅ No code injection or memory modification
- ✅ Zero account termination risk
- ✅ Used by 17Lands, MTGA Assistant, and other endorsed tools

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 10), Bootstrap CSS
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 10 Web API, PostgreSQL
- **Desktop Client**: Avalonia UI (.NET 10) with auto-update via Velopack (future)
- **Hosting**: Azure (Static Web Apps + App Service)
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Bicep (Infrastructure as Code)

## Project Status

🚧 **In Active Development** - Not yet publicly available

Current phase: Phase 3 - Scryfall Integration & Card Management

**Completed:**

- ✅ Authentication (Register, Login, JWT + Refresh Tokens)
- ✅ Collections CRUD (view, add, edit, delete with pagination and filtering)
- ✅ Card search and detail pages (Scryfall data integration)
- ✅ Database schema (Users, Cards, Collections)
- ✅ 147 tests (138 passing, 9 skipped pending HTTP mocking)

**Next:**

- 🔄 Import/export features (Moxfield CSV, Manabox CSV)
- 🔄 Card details modal enhancements
- 🔄 Azure deployment & CI/CD (Phase 4)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed progress.
