# Utilities CI Pipeline
# Builds utility console applications (ScryfallSync, CardTranslator, etc.) on every push/PR to main
#
# Triggers:
#   - Push to main branch (if utility files changed)
#   - Pull requests targeting main (if utility files changed)
#
# Note: This validates that utilities compile correctly.
# Deployment to Azure (for scheduled execution) is handled separately.
#
# Cost: Free for public repositories (unlimited minutes)
